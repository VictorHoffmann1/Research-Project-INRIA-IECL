Solving fragmentation problems with bayesian neural networks and other machine learning models. This work is currently in progress.

You will find in this repository a jupyter notebook summarizing the machine learning code I used in one fragmentation example about finding the median rock fragment size after a blast. There's also a .PDF file which contains about 60 pages explaining the whole fragmentation problem, introducting some machine learning basics and the models. Furthermore, it describes the machine learning approach I used and shows the results I had. 

All documents are in French.
